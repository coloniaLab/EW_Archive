            the priest to allow him to travel two days in advance, and a strange<lb/>

            <p rend="indent">
            There were Negro slaves in <name type="place">St. Augustine</name>, probably from the very<lb/>
            first, but their number was negligible. Negro slaves of the <name type="person"><name type="person_group">Spanish</name><lb/>

            employed for two years in making wooden platforms for the artillery of<lb/>
            the <name type="place">old fort at St. Augustine</name>. There is also a record of a Negro slave<lb/>
            at the <name type="place">St. Augustine friary</name> in <date when="1469">1569</date>. In <date when="1594">1594</date> the <name type="person">Governor of <name type="place">Florida</name></name><lb/>
            asked the <name type="person">Governor of <name type="nation">Cuba</name></name> for a number of soldiers and a "few slaves."<lb/>

            <date when="1597">1597</date>, a Negroess in the royal service tended "soldiers, Indian, and<lb/>

            of whom were women. It is likely that these Negro slaves were servants,<lb/>

            <p rend="indent">
            However, the Indians reacted so unsatisfactorily to strenuous manual<lb/>
            labor that the arrival of Negro slaves for field work was hailed with<lb/>
            joy. A shout went up as the ship of <name type="person">Don Juan de Aila</name> came to another in<lb/>
            the <name type="place">harbor of St. Agustine</name> in <date when="1687">1687</date>, a shout that was the beginning of<lb/>
            a celebration lasting all day. For, on the ship of the Don, in addition<lb/>
            to the usual cargo, was a black slave, the one survivor of the 12 that<lb/>

            new slave had companions because the <name type="person_group">Spaniards</name> were strict; in<lb/>
            addition to other qualifications, a slave was required to become a<lb/>

            The slave of <name type="person">Don Juan</name> was not long to remain alone; in the years<lb/>

            It was during this period of the first <name type="person_group">Spanish</name> occupation of<lb/>
            <name type="place">Florida</name> that the connection between the Negro and the Indian first<lb/>
            occurred. Indians were if the <name type="person_group">Creek</name> and <name type="person_group">Yamaneo</name> tribes, who occupied<lb/>
            a wide territory in what was later to be <name type="place">Georgia</name>. Both Indians and<lb/>
            Negroes frequently escaped from their masters in <name type="place">Carolina</name>, and made<lb/>
            their way southward to the <name type="person_group">Spanish</name> territory of <name type="place">Florida</name>. Here the<lb/>
            <name type="person_group">Spaniards</name> erected a fort for the refugees, a few miles north of their<lb/>

            and <date when="1695">1695</date>; it consisted of a large square with breastwork and four<lb/>
            bastions. In and near this fort a larger group of Negroes lived in<lb/>

            The constant escape of Negro and Indian slaves from <name type="place">Carolina</name> to<lb/>

            <pb n="4" facs="../images/ew_d5_1687_004.jpg"/>
           ownership of slaves was at first forbidden, as it was believed that<lb/>
            a free state between <name type="place">Florida</name> and <name type="place">Carolina</name> would greatly reduce the<lb/>
            number of escapes. After eight years, the need for Negro labor ended<lb/>

            the <name type="person_group">English</name> leader, <name type="person">Colonel Palmer</name>, was killed, and many of his men<lb/>

            Indians who had preceded tham, and enjoyed many of the privileges of<lb/>
            free <name type="person_group">Spanish</name> citizenship. Gradually the Indian tribes in <name type="place">Florida</name><lb/>

            that in <date when="1776">1776</date> the Council for Safety of <name type="place">Georgia</name> requested from Congress<lb/>

            About this date it became known that Indians and Negro runaways<lb/>

            addition to the settlements they already had in eastern and central<lb/>

            the last in their history--was made possible by the war between <name type="nation">England</name><lb/>
            and the <name type="nation">American colonies</name>, the largely unexplored condition of <name type="place">Florida</name><lb/>
            as a whole, and the fact that within the <name type="place">Carolina</name>, <name type="place">North Georgia</name>, and<lb/>

            slaves were brought to <name type="place">Florida</name> in great numbers. The majority of them<lb/>

            Toward the Indians and their Negro allies the Spanish governors<lb/>

            and the <name type="person">Hansons</name> in <name type="place">St. Johns</name> , carefully avoided separating families<lb/>
            when buying or selling slaves; others almost never sold a slave, and<lb/>
            refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. One slave remembers<lb/>
            that he was never forced to do any strenuous work as long as he beat<lb/>
            the slaves of the other masters at marbles; another was permitted to earn<lb/>

            That some of these kind masters may have been known to the slaves<lb/>

            One such instance occurred on the <name type="place"><name type="person">Cone</name> plantation</name> in <name type="place">Columbia County</name> ;<lb/>

            traveling in <name type="place">Florida</name>  out of curiosity, entered into a 7-year period<lb/>

            Slaves reacted differently to cruel masters; some were thoroughly<lb/>

            slave was doubled about a hoe, shovel or board, tied, and left to lie<lb/>
            in the hot sun. The "bell-and-stocks" system, where an iron halter<lb/>
            was placed around the waist and neck of the slave and a loud bell<lb/>
            attached to it, was another popular method of punishment. And of<lb/>

            Despite the fact that escapes were blamed on whatever free Negroes<lb/>

                  from the coast myself. They were mostly fine young men and women, and<lb/>
                  nearly in equal numbers. I never interfered with their connubial<lb/>
                  concerns, nor domestic affairs, but let them regulate these after<lb/>
                  their own manner. I taught them nothing but what was useful, and<lb/>
                  what I thought would add to their physical and moral happiness. I<lb/>
                  encouraged as much as possible dancing, merriment and dress, for which<lb/>
                  Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated; and,<lb/>

                  to excite their ambition and attachment by kindness; not to depress<lb/>
                  their spirits by fear and punishment. I never allowed them to visit,<lb/>
