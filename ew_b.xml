            Jacksonville, Florida<lb/>
            
            My dear Miss White:<lb/>
            
            I noticed recently your publication with reference<lb/>
            to (the) History Society for Jacksonville Negroes.<lb/>
            
            I have always felt that some one should write a<lb/>
            history of the Negroes of our city, as far back<lb/>
            as we can get information, so that in future years<lb/>
            the young generation will know of some of the<lb/>
            accomplishments and hardships. You have my hearty<lb/>
            support and if i can be of any service to you, <lb/>
            call on me. 
            
            Mayor Aslop called me and stated that he wanted to <lb/>
            appoint you and myself as an Advisory Committee on<lb/>
            the Slum Housing Act, and ask that I talk with <lb/>
            Mr. Bradshaw, who I saw this morning and he<lb/>
            suggested that we talk with Mr. Edwards in Barnett<lb/>
            Bank building next Monday or Tuesday. Please get<lb/>
            in touch with me for this meeting. 
            
            May I wish for you continued good health and success. 
            
            Very truly yours, 
            
            A.L. LEWIS, PRESIDENT
