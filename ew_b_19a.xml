                        On the <date when="1901-01-15">15th day of January, in the year 1901</date>,<lb/>
                        seven members of <name type="place" subtype="city">Jacksonville's</name> black community <lb/>
                  effected the organization of what would become the <lb/>
                  <name type="company">Afro-American Life Insurance Company</name>. The names <lb/>
                  of these men, forever engraved upon the memory of<lb/>
                  those to follow in their footsteps, were <name type="person">Reverend E.J. <lb/>
                  Gregg</name>, <name type="person">Mr. E.W. Latson</name>, <name type="person">Mr. A.L. Lewis</name>, <name type="person">Mr. A.W. <lb/>

                     <p>
                        These men each invested $100 of their hard-<lb/>
                  earned income in the simple premise that a group of <lb/>
                  people, impoverished in spirit and living in a sub-<lb/>
                  standard existence because of the circumstances of their <lb/>
                  color, badly needed help. Two obvious truths moti- <lb/>
                  vated the action of the seven founders: the sick and <lb/>
                  injured required ministration and medication; the dead <lb/>
                  rightfully deserved to be given a dignified burial. <lb/>

                       Hardly had the order of business gotten under way <lb/>
                   when disaster struck the young organization, in the <lb/>
                   form of the terrible <name type="event">Jacksonville fire of 1901</name>. Every- <lb/>
                   thing but a few records was destroyed by the flames <lb/>
                   and gutted most of the city's business area. However, <lb/>
                   undaunted and possessed of indomitable willpower <lb/>
                   and tenacity, the organizers set out to rebuild the <lb/>
                  <name type="company">Company</name>- like a Phoenix arising from the still- <lb/>
                   smoldering ashes. One individual- <name type="person">Miss Eartha M. <lb/>

                   the <name type="company">Company</name>. As best she could, she salvaged what <lb/>
                   remained of invaluable books and records, making it <lb/>
                   possible for the <name type="company">Company</name> to stay in business and to<lb/>

                     later became active in civic and social work; and<lb/>
                     during the following years she became nationally-<lb/>
